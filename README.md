# hedge-fund-broadcast-service
A hedge fund broadcast service to ensure that the portfolios of multiple cryptocurrency exchange accounts follow the fund index.

The service allows you to use one portfolio as an index, and multiple portfolios as subordinate accounts, thus performing portfolio synchronization.

The service rebalances the slave portfolios on schedule, ensuring the optimal ratio of different coins, fixing profits and averaging drawdowns for each coin.

The service takes into account the limits of the exchange and trading instruments, and also ensures maximum efficiency at the time of rebalancing, by using trading pairs with the lowest limits on transactions and further conversion into a stablecoin.

The Telegram bot is used as a user interface, it provides daily reports, portfolio freezing and hedging percentage management functions.

Currently supported exchanges:
- Binance
- Coinbase

Support for other exchanges can be added upon request.
